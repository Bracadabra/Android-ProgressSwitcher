    <string name="description">The moose (North America) or Eurasian elk (Europe) (Alces alces)
        is the largest extant species in the deer family. Moose are distinguished by the palmate
        antlers of the males; other members of the family have antlers with a dendritic ("twig-like")
        configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal and mixed deciduous forests of the Northern
        Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Moose used to have a much wider range but
        hunting and other human activities greatly reduced it over the years. Moose have been
        reintroduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most moose are found in Canada,
        Alaska, Scandinavia and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic
        vegetation. The most common moose predators are wolves, bears, and humans. Unlike most
        other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds. Although generally
        slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive and move surprisingly quickly if
        angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn can lead to spectacular fights
        between males competing for a female.</string>
